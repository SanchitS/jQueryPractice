# jQueryPractice
 
This repository is a copied-and-edited version of [spbooks/jquery1](https://github.com/spbooks/jquery1) which was made using the book **jQuery : Novice to Ninja**- A book by *EARLE CASTLEDINE & CRAIG SHARKIE*

**If you want to learn jQuery using that book you can either download/fork this repository or download/fork [spbooks/jquery1](https://github.com/spbooks/jquery1)**

In **spbooks/jquery** there is a separate folder for each jquery action, but in this repository there is a single .js(jQuery), .html and .css file. And the jQuery file is made with the use of comments like this.

```
  //__________________________________________________________________chapter_02/01_Lorem_Ipsum/script.js
  //
  //$(document).ready(function () {
  //    alert('Hooray! This is an alert message');
  //});
```

( **chapter_0X/01_Lorem_Ipsum/script.js** means this code is the first exampe from the the second chapter. )

What you have to do is either uncommenting the required code like this
```
  //__________________________________________________________________chapter_02/01_Lorem_Ipsum/script.js
  //
  $(document).ready(function () {
      alert('Hooray! This is an alert message');
  });
```
 or write your own code below that very code (which is obviously a better way to learn, and i recommend that because the more you write, more you learn).
 
 **Enjoy**
